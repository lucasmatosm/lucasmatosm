Hi there! 😁
My name is Lucas Matos. I've been working as Front-End and Developer since 2016 and currently I'm Senior developer at Accenture do Brasil. I am passionate about web development, always looking to learn new technologies and deepen my skills.

In my free time I like  to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺),listen to music (🎵) and talk about technology with my friends.
